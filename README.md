This repository contains the code and data necessary to replicate the findings reported at Paternina-Die et al. 2023

- The Jupyter notebook "interactive_vertex-wise_map_explorer.ipynb" allows for the interactive visualization of vertex-wise results. Note that it will be necessary to install the correspondent python libraries.

- Ready-to-explore 3D (html) visualizations for vertex-wise results showed in Figure 1 are also available in the folder `interactive_vertex-wise_plots`.
